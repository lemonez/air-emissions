    # MonthlyCokerOLD(): # why do old cokers not need EFs??

# bug
    # When selecting only the first months of the year without later months,
    # certain equipment raise KeyError because no PI tags yet for CEMS that were
    # installed later in the year. When all months are run concurrently, the
    # CEMS df is populated w/ NaN for months where that unit was not yet built,
    # because of the merging of dfs at the year level. Need to build in logic to
    # look in the PI tag dictionary for what SHOULD be there, and add column of
    # NaN values for that PI tag for months where that unit doesn't exist.

- if oxygen > 1% , need to first recalculate GBTU/CF value
    (change and see if it affects results)

# feature
    # don't parse CEMS if not needed (currently just a hacky if/else in class method

# feature
    # function to clean up messy missing value flags written for PM10/PM25

# refactor
    # merge CokerCO2 class into base coker class to enable method sharing

# refactor
    # move parse_annual_h2stack to H2Plant class?


- out put 2 sig figs instead of decimal places
- implement flag and file naming scheme for GHG output
- fix argparse so that you can enter equipment as list (right now it lists the string you enter)
- add unit 10 crude values together for output
- incorporate H2S code into class, refactor
- concatenate H2s output with other pollutants


# TODO: refactor calculate_monthly_equip_emissions() method; it is a hot mess
# TODO: refactor convert_from_ppm() into 'convert_from_ppm' and 'convert_from_mscfh' methods
# TODO: refactor first three methods for calculating toxics; they are tangled
