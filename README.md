# air-emissions
tool to calculate refinery emissions for government reporting

#########
##USAGE##
#########

1)  Edit config.py to specify months, emissions units, and equipment
    of interest, filepaths, etc.
    By default all months are parsed for all equipment,
    emissions are calculated, and annual aggregated
    summary results are written to CSVs in './output/'.

2)  Run the following from the command line:
 $ python3 __main.py__
 $ %run __main__.py # or run it this way from Jupyter

##CALCULATIONS / DATA FLOW##
############################

    For each type of fuel gas, the following values are calculated
        - monthly average HHVs from weekly lab analyses
        - monthly average f-factors from weekly lab analyses
    For each refinery equipment unit, emissions are calculated from:
        - hourly CEMS from PI tags
        - hourly fuel usage from PI tags
        - monthly emission factors (for equipment without CEMS)
    Emissions are calculated for the following pollutants:
        - NOx, CO, SO2, VOC, PM, PM25, PM10, H2SO4, H2S; CO2 can be calculated for E/W cokers (2019+)
    Emissions are calculated and summed on a monthly basis and expressed as:
        - monthly totals
        - quarterly totals
        - annual totals
    H2S emissions for boilers and heaters are based on H2S CEMS from the following systems:
        - RFG       --> 30AI568A
        - Coker     --> 12AI55A, 12AI3751.PV (new cokers 2019+)
        - Crude VTG --> 10AI136A

##NOTES##
#########

- Boiler #5 has a different EF for Zinc; this EF is added to the table as 'Zinc_boiler5', as if it were just another TAP and is therefore calculated for all emissions units. The resulting Zinc_boiler5 values are meaningless for all emissions units except for boiler 5, and the 'Zinc' value is meaningless for boiler 5.
